Hi, I’m Hoang!  
I’m a third-year Data Science student at the [University of Science - VNUHCM](https://hcmus.edu.vn/), passionate about machine learning and AI research. I approach my work with strong attention to detail and a commitment to high-quality results.  
Currently, I’m expanding my knowledge by studying a variety of research areas, including but not limited to Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and Mixture-of-Experts, as I explore foundational ideas and work towards identifying my long-term research interests.
