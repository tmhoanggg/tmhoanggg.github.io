Hi, I'm Hoang!

I'm a third-year Data Science student at [University of Science - VNUHCM](https://hcmus.edu.vn/), passionate about machine learning, AI applications, and research. I approach my work with a strong attention to detail and a commitment to high-quality results.

Iâ€™m currently seeking an internship opportunity in Data Science, Machine Learning, or AI, where I can apply my skills and gain hands-on experience.
